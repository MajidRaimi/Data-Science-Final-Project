# 🏠 House Price Prediction Comparison

## 📚 Project Overview
In this project, we aim to compare the performance of two popular machine learning models, Random Forest and XGBoost, in predicting house prices. We utilize the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/code) from Kaggle to train and evaluate our models. This project is part of our coursework for the Data Science program at Imam Abdulrahman University.
